# Pre Work Study Guide Webpage

An informative web page designed to help students with notes on code topics.

Split into 4 categories; HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Git, this page offers notes on these 4 key pillars in front end web development. It solves the problem of consolidating all new information learned in one place, which can be referred back to at any time.

It was also a useful exercise as an initial introduction to using the CLI and VSCode. I learned basic HTML, CSS, Git and JS in the process, and how all can be combined in order to create a dynamic webpage.
